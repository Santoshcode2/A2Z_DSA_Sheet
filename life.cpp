                                                                      MY  ENGINEERING   JOURNEY   
                             
I  join my college on 11th November ,2022  in NIT DURGAPUR ,West Bengal .
Out of 10lakh candidates , I secure a AIR of 32,523 [& OBC rank-> 8495 out of 4-Lakh students] that is top 3.25% of students 
In 2022.   
In my first year of college ,
I run behind my CGPA, some club audition ,sports.
But not able to get into any clubs .  // NO Problem linkedIn is there  
I realize that I have to work on my 
personality development ,
my talking skill,
walking style,        but rememeber one thing you should be strict at each & every place | you have to stand for yourself & do what you like & become master in one      domain in which you love that is important
health(weight)
AT semester break of first year ,
I practise many GATE questions ,//GATE IS NOT MY NOW MAIN MOTO [02-06-2024]//now main goal 18/12/2024
Math sir classes // [29/04/2024] //biggest loss here i should think what actually ece student are doing-market scope &demand
And decided to move towards gov. job (any PSU  /   IES)
CGPA=8.22 (First Year)[1st sem=8.29  &  2nd sem=8.10]           

Starting of second year(3rd semester)
I purchase a new laptop (HP PAVILION) of Rs 57,000 on 21st July ,2023.
I thought now I will began coding and try to check whether I have any interest or not. 
Completed C++ basics ,
And studied college subjects in depth
Go to math sir classes
  
Semester break (3rd semester)
Decided to complete:
1. DSA upto 40-45 lectures (by love babbar).
2. solve GATE question of NETWORK & SIGNAL SYSTEM
3. Take a project under a prof.//BUT NOT TAKEN (BUT TALK WITH THE GOD ANIRUDDHA SIR)
4. complete road map for 4th sem.
Still not clear what to do in future ?--// clear i will not run behind software company
             /*
             as per our campus placements only arm visit [29.5 LPA] but that too on luck basis 
             if OA cleared then max chance you will get selected 
             */ 
             feeling hectic while going to math sir (spending a lot of time) 

             doing something wrong !  //one thing is good i have purchased a laptop

                                                              1. only revise that question of DSA which topics you have covered
