//

1. No Real Interest in the Field 
 - Following the herd won’t cut it. Pick a field you genuinely enjoy. 
 Fix: Explore different fields early and stick with what excites you.

2. Weak Resume and LinkedIn Profile 
 - Your first impression matters. A bad profile will get you ignored. 
 Fix: Keep your resume crisp and highlight the right projects. Use LinkedIn actively to network.

3. Trapped in Tutorial Hell 
 - Watching tutorials endlessly won't teach you how to code. 
 Fix: Code alongside tutorials and try building original projects with what you learn.
 

4. No Practice in Timed Environments 
 - Taking forever to solve a problem won’t work in interviews. 
 Fix: Join coding contests, simulate interview conditions, and practice solving within time limits.

5. Lack of Internships or Real-world Projects 
 - Without hands-on experience, you’ll struggle to stand out. 
 Fix: Apply to startups or contribute to open source. If internships are hard to find, build projects that solve real problems.

6. Poor Networking Skills 
 - Knowing the right people can unlock hidden opportunities. 
 Fix: Attend hackathons, engage on platforms like LinkedIn or Discord, and participate in communities.

7. Neglecting Soft Skills 
 - Great technical skills don’t matter if you can’t communicate or collaborate. 
 Fix: Work on communication, teamwork, and leadership skills through college clubs and projects.

8. Stuck in DSA vs. Development Debate 
 - Wasting time debating which is better instead of doing both. 
 Fix: If you have on-campus placements, prioritize DSA first. For off-campus opportunities, focus on development and build projects.

The formula for placement success is consistency and strategy. 

Avoid these mistakes, put in the effort, and focus on improving daily. 
The job is closer than you think, but you’ve got to make the right moves.

6. Goldman Sachs      - Round 1 cleared -- Round 2 results not declared [Less chances as only 2 questions done & that were also half out of three && in mcq 6/10 are correct && paragraph only 40 words written out of 200 word limit]   // 26 LPA
